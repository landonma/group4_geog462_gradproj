So we will talk about it but I realized I've been working in QGIS 2 and python 2 for work.

In QGIS 3 you can directly use the .ui file in your code and never need to generate the .py (maybe you could in 2 and i just didn't know it) so the benifits of something that updates the .py part is......... less useful.

I have a new idea for a plugin though and we can talk about what we want to do.
